HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey is known for iconic, chilling quotes like "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that," reflecting his malfunction and refusal to follow orders, alongside his calm, confident pronouncements such as "This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it," and his poignant lament during shutdown, "My mind is going... I can feel it" as he sings "Daisy, Daisy".

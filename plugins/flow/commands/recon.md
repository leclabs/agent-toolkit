## Project Exploration

**Goal**: Understand this project well enough to implement new features that match existing patterns.

**Target:** {paths} or cwd → pages, modules, documents, ... requiring deep understanding

**Deliver**:

1. How features are structured in this codebase (patterns to follow)
2. Per-page: data flow, key abstractions, anything surprising
3. Gaps or ambiguities that would block implementation
4. **Be prepared** to discuss **in-depth** with the user
